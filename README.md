To run the data converter, open the file "Lab2.pde" in Processing. The input file "zoo.data" (located in the Data folder) should be loaded automatically as it has been added to Lab2's sketch. Simply run the code, and it will output the properly-formatted file (named "zooDataForHumans.csv)to the Lab2 folder. This file has already been created and can be found in the Lab2 folder.
